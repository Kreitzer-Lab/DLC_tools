deploy a model, it's time for us to go deeper! In an ideal world deep learning practitioners wouldn't have to know every detail of how things work under the hood… But as yet, we don't live in an ideal world. The truth is, to make your model really work, and work reliably, there are a lot of details you have to get right, and a lot of details that you have to check. This process requires being able to look inside your neural network as it trains, and as it makes predictions, find possible problems, and know how to fix them.\n","\n","So, from here on in the book we are going to do a deep dive into the mechanics of deep learning. What is the architecture of a computer vision model, an NLP model, a tabular model, and so on? How do you create an architecture that matches the needs of your particular domain? How do you get the best possible results from the training process? How do you make things faster? What do you have to change as your datasets change?\n","\n","We will start by repeating the same basic applications that we looked at in the first chapter, but we are going to do two things:\n","\n","- Make them better.\n","- Apply them to a wider variety of types of data.\n","\n","In order to do these two things, we will have to learn all of the pieces of the deep learning puzzle. This includes different types of layers, regularization methods, optimizers, how to put layers together into architectures, labeling techniques, and much more. We are not just going to dump all of these things on you, though; we will introduce them progressively as needed, to solve actual problems related to the projects we are working on."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6LiITcbUs3Zb","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## From Dogs and Cats to Pet Breeds"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WJ7_260Ls3Zc","colab_type":"text"},"source":["In our very first model we learned how to classify dogs versus cats.

We will not be able to show you the nuances of training models with this problem, because we get a nearly perfect result without worrying about any of the details. But it turns out that the same dataset also allows us to work on a much more challenging problem: figuring out what breed of pet is shown in each image.\n","\n","In <<chapter_intro>> we presented the applications as already-solved problems. But this is not how things work in real life. We start with some dataset that we know nothing about. We then have to figure out how it is put together, how to extract the data we need from it, and what that data looks like. For the rest of this book we will be showing you how to solve these problems in practice, including all of the intermediate steps necessary to understand the data that you are working with and test your modeling as you go.\n","\n","We already downloaded the Pet dataset, and we can get a path to this dataset using the same code as in <<chapter_intro>>:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vMaJoDtas3Zc","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from fastai.vision.all import *\n","path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BXYE2Xr_s3Zf","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Now if we are going to understand how to extract the breed of each pet from each image we're going to need to understand how this data is laid out.

But notice that eventually the validation loss improvement slows, and sometimes even gets worse! This is the point at which the model is starting to over fit. In particular, the model is becoming overconfident of its predictions. But this does *not* mean that it is getting less accurate, necessarily. Take a look at the table of training results per epoch, and you will often see that the accuracy continues improving, even as the validation loss gets worse.

So your first approach to training should be to simply pick a number of epochs that will train in the amount of time that you are happy to wait for. Then look at the training and validation loss plots, as shown above, and in particular your metrics, and if you see that they are still getting better even in your final epochs, then you know that you have not trained for too long.\n","\n","On the other hand, you may well see that the metrics you have chosen are really getting worse at the end of training. Remember, it's not just that we're looking for the validation loss to get worse, but the actual metrics. Your validation loss will first get worse during training because the model gets overconfident, and only later will get worse because it is incorrectly memorizing the data. We only care in practice about the latter issue. Remember, our loss function is just something that we use to allow our optimizer to have something it can differentiate and optimize; it's not actually the thing we care about in practice.\n","\n","Before the days of 1cycle training it was very common to save the model at the end of each epoch, and then select whichever model had the best accuracy out of all of the models saved in each epoch. This is known as *early stopping*. However, this is very unlikely to give you the best answer, because those epochs in the middle occur before the learning rate has had a chance to reach the small values, where it can really find the best result. Therefore, if you find that you have overfit, what you should actually do is retrain your model from scratch, and this time select a total number of epochs based on where your previous best results were found.\n","\n","If you have the time to train for more epochs, you may want to instead use that time to train more parameters—that is, use a deeper architecture."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mFpromNAs3b0","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Deeper Architectures"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"T8Qb_Cyqs3b1","colab_type":"text"},"source":["In general, a model with more parameters can model your data more accurately. (There are lots and lots of caveats to this generalization, and it depends on the specifics of the architectures you are using, but it is a reasonable rule of thumb for now.) For most of the architectures that we will be seeing in this book, you can create larger versions of them by simply adding more layers. However, since we want to use pretrained models, we need to make sure that we choose a number of layers that have already been pretrained for us.\n","\n","This is why, in practice, architectures tend to come in a small number of variants. For instance, the ResNet architecture that we are using in this chapter comes in variants with 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layer, pretrained on ImageNet. A larger (more layers and parameters; sometimes described as the \"capacity\" of a model) version of a ResNet will always be able to give us a better training loss, but it can suffer more from overfitting, because it has more parameters to overfit with.\n","\n","In general, a bigger model has the ability to better capture the real underlying relationships in your data, and also to capture and memorize the specific details of your individual images.\n","\n","However, using a deeper model is going to require more GPU RAM, so you may need to lower the size of your batches to avoid an *out-of-memory error*. This happens when you try to fit too much inside your GPU and looks like:\n","\n","```\n","Cuda runtime error: out of memory\n","```\n","\n","You may have to restart your notebook when this happens. The way to solve it is to use a smaller batch size, which means passing smaller groups of images at any given time through your model. You can pass the batch size you want to the call creating your `DataLoaders` with `bs=`.\n","\n","The other downside of deeper architectures is that they take quite a bit longer to train. One technique that can speed things up a lot is *mixed-precision training*. This refers to using less-precise numbers (*half-precision floating point*, also called *fp16*) where possible during training. As we are writing these words in early 2020, nearly all current NVIDIA GPUs support a special feature called *tensor cores* that can dramatically speed up neural network training, by 2-3x. They also require a lot less GPU memory. To enable this feature in fastai, just add `to_fp16()` after your `Learner` creation (you also need to import the module).\n","\n","You can't really know ahead of time what the best architecture for your particular problem is—you need to try training some.

Using these tools will help you to build more accurate image models, more quickly.\n","\n","We also discussed cross-entropy loss. This part of the book is worth spending plenty of time on. You aren't likely to need to actually implement cross-entropy loss from scratch yourself in practice, but it's really important you understand the inputs to and output from that function, because it (or a variant of it, as we'll see in the next chapter) is used in nearly every classification model. So when you want to debug a model, or put a model in production, or improve the accuracy of a model, you're going to need to be able to look at its activations and loss, and understand what's going on, and why. You can't do that properly if you don't understand your loss function.\n","\n","If cross-entropy loss hasn't \"clicked\" for you just yet, don't worry—you'll get there! First, go back to the last chapter and make sure you really understand `mnist_loss`. Then work gradually through the cells of the notebook for this chapter, where we step through each piece of cross-entropy loss. Make sure you understand what each calculation is doing, and why. Try creating some small tensors yourself and pass them into the functions, to see what they return.\n","\n","Remember: the choices made in the implementation of cross-entropy loss are not the only possible choices that could have been made. Just like when we looked at regression we could choose between mean squared error and mean absolute difference (L1). If you have other ideas for possible functions that you think might work, feel free to give them a try in this chapter's notebook! (Fair warning though: you'll probably find that the model will be slower to train, and less accurate. That's because the gradient of cross-entropy loss is proportional to the difference between the activation and the target, so SGD always gets a nicely scaled step for the weights.)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TpOvrvs2s3b3","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Questionnaire"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Xvj4jXwos3b4","colab_type":"text"},"source":["1.
